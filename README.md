# Hi there 👋

I'm **Aleks**, an AI solutions developer who loves building intelligent applications and untangling complex data challenges. With a background spanning mathematical optimization, cognitive neuroscience, and software engineering, I specialize in turning technical problems into practical solutions.

## 🚀 About Me
My journey from applied mathematics and neuroscience research to AI solutions development has been driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real-world problems. I've worked on everything from semantic search engines for social services to large-scale neuroimaging data pipelines, always focusing on making complex systems accessible and functional.

Currently at N3XTCODER, I deliver end-to-end AI projects for government initiatives and social impact organizations. Whether it's processing 500+ GB of research data, building rapid prototypes, or synthesizing hundreds of technical sources into educational content, I thrive on connecting disparate pieces into something meaningful.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **AI/ML & NLP**: PyTorch, LangChain, HuggingFace, Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, semantic search
- **Development**: Python, FastAPI, Laravel, TALL Stack, JavaScript, REST APIs
- **Data & Analytics**: Pandas, NetworkX, statistical modeling, large-scale data processing
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Azure, Docker, database systems, optimization solvers

## 🌟 Currently exploring...
- **Languages**: German (fluent), English (fluent), Russian (native speaker)
- **Hobbies**: Birdwatching, fencing, bike repairs 🚴🏼‍♀️
- **Crows**: I adore crows and corvids. Please feel free to ask me for photos or stories about my local gang! 🐦‍⬛
